## üöÄ About Me
üëã Hi there! I'm SAKTHI KUMARAN V G, a Data Scientist with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. Specializing in Machine Learning, I enjoy exploring complex datasets to uncover patterns and drive decision-making.

ü§ñ Currently, I'm deeply immersed in the world of Machine Learning, applying algorithms to solve real-world problems. My toolkit includes Python, R, and SQL for data manipulation and analysis. I leverage tools like PowerBI, Tableau, and Google Colab for visualization and model deployment. When coding, I prefer VS Code for its versatility and efficiency.

üîç With experience in projects such as Default Prediction, TBill forecasting, and Task arrival rate forecasting, I thrive on tackling challenging predictive analytics tasks. Whether it's predicting outcomes or optimizing processes, I'm always up for the challenge.
